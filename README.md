HueClap
=======

The most convenient way to clap yourself to light.

Hue clap is a hackaton project which enables you to turn the lights of your Philips Hue system on and off with clap gestures.

HueClap uses an Arduino with sound sensor to detect and process the claps. This file will be updated with instructions how to set it up.
